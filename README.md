## ‚úèÔ∏è In short

Useful Moderator is a Discord bot that aims to help moderators in their daily tasks. It is written in Python and uses the [discord.py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest) library.

The bot provides a set of commands, which are subdivided into `cogs` (or modules). Each cog is responsible for a specific set of commands.
