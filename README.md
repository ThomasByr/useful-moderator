## ‚úèÔ∏è In short

Useful Moderator is a Discord bot that aims to help moderators in their daily tasks. It is written in Python and uses the [discord.py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest) library.

The bot provides a set of commands, which are subdivided into `cogs` (or modules). Each cog is responsible for a specific set of commands.

You do not explicitly need a conda environment for the bot to run. But it is always recommended nontheless, especially because the next LTS of Ubuntu won't let users pip-install anything without a virtual environment. At the time of writing, this bot requires `python >= 3.9` to run.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ThomasByr/useful-moderator.git
cd useful-moderator
```

You can create and activate a conda environment with the following commands :

```bash
# Create the environment
conda create -n dsc python=3.11
conda activate dsc
```

Then, install the dependencies :

```bash
# Install the dependencies
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Finally, run the bot in the background with `bash run.bash` or type the following :

```bash
# Run the bot (lets you Ctrl+C to stop it)
python useful_moderator.py
```

## üíÅ Get Help

Inside the Discord app, you can type

```txt
/<GroupName> help
```

to get help about a specific group of commands. For example, you can type `/utils help` to get help about the `utils` group of commands.

You can try to ping the bot in your guild to start üëã :

```txt
/utils ping
```
